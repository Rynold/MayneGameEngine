# MayneGameEngine
This is a work in progress GameEngine 

This Graphics Renderer is the begining of a game engine I have been working on during my spare time. It uses modern OpenGL
to create great looking scenes. So far the rendering capabilities include: Textures, Normal Maps, Parralax Mapping, Directional Lights,
Point Lights, Soft Shadows, SkyBoxes and Model Loading.

It also has basic Networking right now Moving the camera in the client will now also move the camera on the server. Most recent I integrated
the bullet physics engine.

I plan on further developing my code to allow it to become more flexible, readable and proficient. Next I plan on extending my shader class
so I can create custom shader classes to make the code more proficient. I also plan on making a Uniforms class to make the code more readable.
